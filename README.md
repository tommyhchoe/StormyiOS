Weather app for iOS

This app gives the weather forecast based on the user's current location. 
Users are able to see a weekly and daily weather forecast. In addition, they also have the ability to set the temperature scale, i.e., from celsius to fahrenheit and vice versa. 

*new-feature-branch is where new features are added. Make sure you clone/fork directly from the master branch as the new-feature-branch may have stability issues.*
